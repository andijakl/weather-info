# Weather Info App (Sample app for async / await and fetch API in Node.js)

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to make asynchronous web requests using Node.js. It utilizes the fetch API, which is now stable in Node.js 21 and can be used without loading additional packages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you will need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Once you have obtained the API key, replace the corresponding line in the `index.js` file with your API key.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application by running `node index.js`.
4. The app will fetch weather information from OpenWeatherMap API and display it in the console.
